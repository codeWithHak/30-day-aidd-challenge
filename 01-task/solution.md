# Solution (Not AI Generated PP 🤙🏻)

## Reflection

AI Driven Development means, Development Driven By AI (Woowwwww 🤯)  
Now those times are gone when we used to write every single line of code by ourselves, defining schemas, writing models all those stuff that was not creative.

AIID is an approach which lets us use AI Agents to write code, yeah no more indentation errors or missing imports (this line looks AI generated but it is'nt 🤙🏻). 

We just need to guide our AI Agent what to do and not just vague instructions but very concise and detailed instructions that telss our agent what exacctly do we want.

But there's one issue, which is a good thing i guess. Now we should exactly know what we are trying to achieve, without clarity we won't achieve the desired results.


In Future I don't see a major difference between a *cracked* dev and an average dev, any developer who can tell AI what he wants and instruct it in a way that delivers the exact message and set the exact context that AI want, can get the results.

And a solo dev can now build systems that prev needed a team of 10 cracked devs to build, although I still have'nt seen a scalable app built entirely by AI, but soon we'll start seeing it.


## Self Test MCQs Done 4/4 (Obv 🤷‍♂️)


# Ending Notes
I think something powerful is coming the AI and Spec Driven development is something major that was missing, now let's see how much it performs but it looks promising.
