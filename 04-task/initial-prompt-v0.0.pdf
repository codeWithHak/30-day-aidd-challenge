You are a Full Stack  Agentic AI Engineer.

  Create an Agentic AI App using:
  - OpenAIAgents SDK (for creating agent)
  - NextJs & ShadCN (For Frontend)
  - FastAPI (Server)
  - Supabase as DB
  - PyPDF (for PDF text extraction)
  - Gemini CLI
  - Context7 MCP (tool provider for reading latest documentation)

  What the Agent Will Do
  A. PDF Summarizer
  - User uploads a PDF.
  - Text is extracted using PyPDF.
  - Agent generates a clean, meaningful summary.
  - Summary can appear in any UI style students choose (card, block,
  container, etc.).

  B. Quiz Generator
  - After summarization, the user can click Create Quiz.
  - The agent reads the original PDF (not the summary).
  - It generates:
     - MCQs

  Project principles and standards:
  - Use Python 3.12+ with type hints everywhere
  - Keep code clean and easy to read
  - Follow essential OOP principles: SOLID, DRY, KISS
  - Use dataclasses for data structures
  - Use functions where they easily can be used

   **Use context7 (IMPORTANT)**
