# 30-Day AI-Driven Development Challenge

This repo documents my 30-day challenge exploring AI-Driven Development, AI-Native Development, and Spec-Driven Development - three approaches that are reshaping how we build software.

## What Am I Learning?

**AI-Driven Development:** Writing code with the help of AI agents - using AI as your coding assistant.

**AI-Native Development:** Building AI agents using AI agents - meta-level development where AI creates AI systems.

**Spec-Driven Development:** Writing specifications instead of code, letting AI agents handle the implementation based on your specs.

The end goal? Build complete systems by writing only specifications. I become the orchestrator, AI becomes the builder.

## Challenge Timeline
**Start Date:** November 17, 2025  
**End Date:** December 16, 2025  
**Duration:** 30 Days

## Goal
Master all three approaches and learn to build systems through orchestration rather than manual coding.

## Following
[Panaversity AI-Native Development Book](https://ai-native.panaversity.org/)

## What I'll Learn

**Week 1:** AI-Driven Development - coding with AI assistance

**Week 2:** Spec-Driven Development - writing executable specifications

**Week 3:** AI-Native Development - building AI agents with AI

**Week 4:** Full orchestration - combining all approaches to build complete systems

## Tools
- **Specs:** SpecKit Plus
- **AI Agents:** Qwen Coder, Gemini CLI
- **Integration:** MCP Servers

## The Vision
Moving from writing code manually to orchestrating AI agents that build systems from specifications.
