# Solution

## What is SpecKit Plus:
SpecKit Plus is a toolkit that solves the problem vibe coding introduces.
With vibe coding in no time our codebase gets messy and we can't understand what code AI has written and if we try to fix one thing the other gets broken.

So wiht SpecKit Plus we dont vibe code we just write specifications and the agent codes on our specifications we set everything like the rules, principles, best practices, and more.

Basically we will give the LLM a very rich and concise context so it knows what praactices we follow what's our history and everything we've done so far.

It gets the context of our whole system, so by using the spec driven approach we can build scalable and maintainable systems that does not get polluted over time.

## 1- sp.constitution

sp.constitution will be the first command we will run when creating a specifications by using this command we will setup some ground rules, standards, and principles for our LLM that it must follow. 

e.g: Use type hints, follow KISS principle.

## 2- sp.specify

sp.specify will be the second command we will run.

Now by using this second command we will give our requirements, the features we need, and the Agent will generate the specifications for us.

## 3- sp.plan

sp.plan will be the third command we will run, in this we will create a plan for our specifications means its time to plan the "How".

## 4- sp.task

By now we have a solid plan now we will break down that plan into small micro tasks that take 15 to 30 minutes to be completed.

## 5- sp.implement

Now tasks are ready to be implemented by using this command we will implement the tasks and the Agnet will start the implementation.
